Hi, I‚Äôm Chisom Okwor! Everyone calls me **Chee-soh-mu**. I'm a software engineer and innovator, passionate about building impactful solutions that push the boundaries of technology. 
Currently, I work as a software engineer on the [Google Geo Automotive Team](https://developers.google.com/cars).

I‚Äôm a firm believer in continuous learning, philosophy, and exploring how technology shapes the future.
On my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPN2Q16hpuRBjJXbwX9keLw), I share insights on building apps, AI projects, navigating tech careers, and helping others unlock their potential in this rapidly evolving field.

In my free time, I'm pursuing a [Master‚Äôs Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Austin](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai). 
I‚Äôm also committed to fostering diversity in tech through [The Black Tech Mixer](https://www.techriseglobal.com/gallery) 
an initiative I co-founded to connect professionals and discuss the future of emerging technology and its impact on the Black diaspora and Africa.
